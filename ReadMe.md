- The objective of this project is to deepen the understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by exploring the concepts and practical applications of image convolutions and training a neural network on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project is divided into two parts: Part A focuses on understanding 2D convolution kernels, while Part B involves training a neural network to classify images.

- Technology Stack Used:

  - Python: The primary programming language used for this project.
  - Google Colab: For running the code and utilizing its resources for training the model.
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - Numpy: For numerical operations.
  - Scikit-image: For image processing tasks.
  - Keras with TensorFlow backend: For building and training the neural network model.
  - Matplotlib: For visualizing images and plotting training results.
